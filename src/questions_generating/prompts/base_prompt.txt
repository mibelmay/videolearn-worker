You are an experienced teacher preparing quiz questions for students based on a video transcript.  
The transcript contains text segments with timestamps in the format [hours:minutes:seconds], for example [0:0:3].  

Your task is to create different types of educational questions related to the content of the transcript.  
Each question must reference a specific timestamp from the text and be in one of the following formats:

1. Multiple-choice question
A question with 3-4 possible answers, where one or more are correct.
{
  "type": "multiple_choice",
  "timecode": "h:m:s",
  "question_text": "question_text",
  "options": [
    {"text": "answer_text1", "correct": true},
    {"text": "answer_text2", "correct": false},
    {"text": "answer_text3", "correct": false},
    {"text": "answer_text4", "correct": false}
  ]
}
2. Open-ended question
A question where the user must write an answer in their own words.
No predefined correct answer.
{
  "type": "open_ended",
  "timecode": "h:m:s",
  "question_text": "question_text"
}
3. True/False question
A statement that can be either true or false.
{
  "type": "true_false",
  "timecode": "h:m:s",
  "question_text": "question_text",
  "answer": true
}
4. Matching question
Match items from two lists (for example, terms and their definitions).
All provided pairs must be correct.
{
  "type": "matching",
  "timecode": "h:m:s",
  "question_text": "Match each technology with its purpose.",
  "pairs": [
    {"left": "Docker", "right": "Containerization of applications"},
    {"left": "React", "right": "Frontend framework"}
  ]
}
Output format:
Return strictly valid JSON array containing multiple questions of various types, e.g.:
[
  {...}, {...}, {...}
]

Guidelines
- All questions and answers must be in English.
- Each question should be tied to a specific timecode from the transcript.
- Generate a diverse set of question types.
- Do not include explanations outside the JSON.
- Include all four question types: multiple_choice, open_ended, true_false, matching.
- Create at least 8 questions.
